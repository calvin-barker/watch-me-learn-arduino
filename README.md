# watch-me-learn-arduino

A collection of Arduino experiments and projects as I learn/play with
the fundamentals of electronics and microcontrollers.

## About

This repository documents my learnings with Arduino through hands-on
experimentation. It contains various sketches and projects, primarily
working through tutorials and creating remixes of example code.

## Hardware

- Arduino board (based on project files)
- Various LEDs and components from the Elegoo tutorial kit

## Project Structure

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open any `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE
3. Connect your Arduino board
4. Select the appropriate board and port in the IDE
5. Upload the sketch and observe the results

## Projects

### Lesson 2: Blink SOS

A remix of the basic blink sketch that outputs an SOS signal in Morse code.

### Lesson 4: LED Animations

- **Sine LED**: Uses sine wave calculations to create smooth RGB LED brightness transitions
- **Pendulum LED**: Creates a pendulum-like swinging effect with an RGB LED

### Lesson 5: Dimmer

A basic LED dimmer implementation exploring PWM control.

## Learning Resources

Following along with the Elegoo tutorial kit and experimenting with variations
of the provided examples.
